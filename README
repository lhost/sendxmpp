sendxmpp is a perl-script to send XMPP (jabber) messages, similar to
what mail(1) does for mail. XMPP is an open, non-proprietary protocol
for instant messaging. See www.jabber.org for more information.

sendxmpp was written by me, Dirk-Jan C. Binnema, and is available under
the term of the GNU General Public License v2. The hard work is done by
Ryan Eatmon's Net::XMPP-modules, and you need have them installed for
sendxmpp to work. Current maintainer is Lubomir Host <lubomir.host@gmail.com>

Obviously, you also need a jabber account; they are freely available
at https://list.jabber.at/, but you can also install your own servers.
