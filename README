sendxmpp is a perl-script to send XMPP (jabber) messages, similar to
what mail(1) does for mail. XMPP is an open, non-proprietary protocol
for instant messaging. See www.jabber.org for more information.

sendxmpp was written by me, Dirk-Jan C. Binnema, and is available
under the term of the GNU General Public License v2. The hard work is
done by Ryan Eatmon's Net::XMPP-modules, and you need have them
installed for sendxmpp to work.

Obviously, you also need a jabber account; they are freely available
at jabber.org, but you can also install your own servers.

sendxmpp is already in use for monitoring remote servers (servers can
warn by sending xmmp-messages), and watching CVS commit messages
(developers are all connected to a XMPP-chatroom to which messages are
sent. 

I am interested in hearing about other uses.
